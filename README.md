* It should be easy to signup and get the information the user requires.

# Testing
In terms of testing I made sure the navigation bar and socials links were active across all three html pages. I have thourougly gone through all three pages making sure the Home, Facilities and Sign Up allow the user to navigate to all pages only using this. The social icons at the bottom of the page have been tested on all three pages to allow the user to access Facebook, Instagram and Twitter whether they are on the Home, Facilities or Sign Up page. The website is also fully responsive. The main image stays between the header and footer and maintains the zoom effect on all screen sizes. The cards on the facilties page stack on top of eachover leaving adequate spacing. The form stays centered and leaves plenty of room for input even on mobile devices.

## Validator Testing
* No errors were returned when putting my HTML code through W3C validator.
* No errors were found on my CSS file when put through Jigsaw.

## Issues
* Issues I encountered were making sure the main image on the Home page stayed behind the header and footer. This was accomplished by placing a div element within a section and setting the sections position to relative.
* The other issues I encountered were making the cards and form resposive. A number of times they would overlap or worse; move off the screen. I tackled this by using responsive classes I learnt from Bootstrap5.
* I ran into an issue where the images would not load on my deployed website. I fixed this issue by using ../images for my background url in css rather than assets/images.

# Deployment
* I deployed the website to Github Pages by going to Githubs repository. 
* Going over to settings, pages and deploying via the main branch.
