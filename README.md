## Validator Testing
* No errors were returned when putting my HTML code through W3C validator.
* No errors were found on my CSS file when put through Jigsaw.

## Issues
* Issues I encountered were making sure the main image on the Home page stayed behind the header and footer. This was accomplished by placing a div element within a section and setting the sections position to relative.
* The other issues I encountered were making the cards and form resposive. A number of times they would overlap or worse; move off the screen. I tackled this by using responsive classes I learnt from Bootstrap5.
* I ran into an issue where the images would not load on my deployed website. I fixed this issue by using ../images for my background url in css rather than assets/images.

# Deployment
* I deployed the website to Github Pages by going to Githubs repository. 
* Going over to settings, pages and deploying via the main branch.
