* I would also include a page explaning all the health benefits associated with working out, competitions and general advice when it comes to undergoing exercise.

# UX
## Site Goals
* The goals of the website are to give the user all the information they need about the services Mt.Olympus offers. They will be able to navigate smoothly through a simplistic website, however including all relavant information. 
* It should be easy to signup and get the information the user requires.

# Wireframes
![wireframe](/assets/images/wireframes.png)
* These are the original designs using wireframe. The website stayed true to this with the header and footer being consistent through all three pages. The only iteration was made to the styling of the navigation bar.

# Testing
In terms of testing I made sure the navigation bar and socials links were active across all three html pages. I have thourougly gone through all three pages making sure the Home, Facilities and Sign Up allow the user to navigate to all pages only using this. The social icons at the bottom of the page have been tested on all three pages to allow the user to access Facebook, Instagram and Twitter whether they are on the Home, Facilities or Sign Up page. The website is also fully responsive. The main image stays between the header and footer and maintains the zoom effect on all screen sizes. The cards on the facilties page stack on top of eachover leaving adequate spacing. The form stays centered and leaves plenty of room for input even on mobile devices.

## Issues
* Issues I encountered were making sure the main image on the Home page stayed behind the header and footer. This was accomplished by placing a div element within a section and setting the sections position to relative.
* The other issues I encountered were making the cards and form resposive. A number of times they would overlap or worse; move off the screen. I tackled this by using responsive classes I learnt from Bootstrap5.
* I ran into an issue when deploying my website. The background images you see throughout the README file are not loading on the deployed website. I have moved the images from my style.css to the relevant html pages. After using styling such as z-index and changing the images from a jpg file to a webp file I cannot get them to load. I have tried a number of methods, however I cannot get my css images to load on the deployed website.

# Deployment
* I deployed the website to Github Pages by going to Githubs repository. 
* Going over to settings, pages and deploying via the main branch.
